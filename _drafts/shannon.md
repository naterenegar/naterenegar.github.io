# What we can learn from Claude Shannon
I want to synthesize some ideas from Shannon's work for myself. Putting it
together into a post I can revisit will be helpful.

A couple of sources:

Many very successful people tell the youth to go to the heart of things. To
break down concepts until are left with bare immutable core. This is known as
"First Principles" thinking. Claude Shannon talked about it. Elon Musk talks
about it. Lex Fridman talks about it. Richard Hamming talks about it. Many
successful engineers credit this mode of thought.

Claude Shannon clearly thought this way. How else could you come up with a
speed limit on communication?

Imagine you want to send data over a channel that may corrupt the data, and
furthermore that you have an existing solution that isn't suitable under one
criterion (e.g. speed). You may ask, "how can I make this communication
faster?". This is not first principles. So you ask, "Why wasn't the existing
solution fast enough?". Also, not quite first principles but in the right
direction.
