# Dendritic Trees
I want to read the literature on dendritic trees and come up with a
mathematical formulation of their computational ability.

Regardless of novelty, this will be a good exercise for me as a student in this
field.

A couple of questions:
1. There is a large variety of structure and function of dendritic trees both
   inter-organism (across species) and intra-organism (within species). Is
   there a fundamental similarity here? A substrate augmented by some other
   factor? Or a different substrate entirely?
2. If there is a "fundamental substrate", what are the rules for augmenting it? 
   Is it nonlinear, or linear? How does this compare to the abstraction we see
   in computer science of "weighted sum"?
3. How does a given dendritic tree change over time?
