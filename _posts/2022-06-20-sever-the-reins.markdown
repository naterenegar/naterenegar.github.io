The mind is a joker, a trickster and thief
"Make a decision, and you'll find relief"
The subconcious says with a grin, cheek to cheek,
but not of the kind you ought to seek.
No! Shed the harness! Sever the reins!
Primal desire plagues our brains!

No grass is green without water
And definitely not greener if you set it on fire
"Make a decision, and you'll find relief"
Ephemeral green, green too brief
The brain is a fucking liar!
Off to damage someone elses daughter

And so I go, scorching the earth
Devil clutching optic nerves 
like a cowboy clutching reins
