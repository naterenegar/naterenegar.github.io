Writing is hard. This blog is a means for me to improve my writing while
sharing some of my ideas. It's not that I think any of my ideas are necessarily
worth sharing, but rather a desire to articulate and to spend time developing
ideas. Somehow I must regard and disregard the audience simultaneously. With no
regard, I will write unpalatable nonsense. With too much regard, fear of how I
will be perceived kicks in. Running this ridge while personally extracting
value from writing is a skill.

Writing forces you to sit down and determine what you want to say. Ironically,
that hasn't been determined for the blog. I've got all the ingredients, but
need to knead the dough a bit. Sometimes my head is swimming and I need to
sit down and let the thoughts out, without regard for coherence. Writing is the
kneading that turns these ingredients into something delicious, something
edible, at least. 

More soon.
